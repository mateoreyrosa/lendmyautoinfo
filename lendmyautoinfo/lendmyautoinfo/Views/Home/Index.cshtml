                Avoid the rental counter. As a member you gain access to a network of “car sharers” 
                
                saving you hundreds to thousands of dollars in car rental at airports or wherever your travels take you.

                You share your car while you’re away traveling or not in use and someone else shares their car for you to use at your final destination.  
                Simple as that. A community of “car-sharers.”

                What about Insurance?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Don’t stress about insurance.  Once vetted by one of our representatives our 
                members can elect to use their own insurance or use our $1,000,000 comprehensive insurance policy.  
                In either case as an owner your vehicle is protected.  
                We steer clear from insurance add-on’s you don’t need. Click “here” to learn more.
