            With nothing more than a backpack, our founder Brandon Steinbeigle has been fortunate enough to travel through some of the poorest parts of this planet. 
            During his travels, his outlook of this world changed. He realized that you don’t need a lot in life to be completely content. 
            He realized that true happiness comes from our experiences and through our interactions, connections with others.

            In August of 2017, with a few hundred bucks to his name, Brandon founded lendmyauto.com while driving down an empty street lined with some of Portland, Oregon’s homeless. 
            Not being too far away from being homeless himself he knew he had a responsibility in this world do more for others who have less.

                The marketplace today is crowded with companies that claim to be a part of the “sharing” economy. Sharing shouldn’t be conditional.
                There are over 1 billion cars in this world and rental car companies such as Enterprise, Hertz, etc. add millions of cars to our congested roads and make billions of dollars every year.
                When you arrive at the airport your car sits there for a several days if not for several weeks at a time not being used. What if you could land at your destination, walk out to the parking garage, hop into someone’s else’s car and be on your way?
                No more lines.
                No more paying hundreds of dollars at the rental car counter or being sold on insurance you don’t need.  Doesn’t it make sense to use resources that are already sitting there?
            </p>
            <p>
                What if we were to share our cars that we already own unconditionally?
                Could we save hundreds to thousands of dollars every year?
                Could we connect with others around the world?
                Could we get to the point of trusting complete strangers with our cars?
            </p>
            <p>
                Traveling is expensive. You need to book a hotel or reserve an Airbnb and rent a car to get where you’re headed. What if together, we created a community of people willing to share unconditionally?  
                We would eliminate the high cost of travel and perhaps we can use that money to buy life experiences that traveling can afford you.
                Would this lead to a more understanding society? Could people who live so far away become a little closer?
