        With his life savings in hand and a dream in mind our founder Brandon Steinbeigle
        envisions a world where we can enrich our own lives by sharing our own cars while saving
        hundreds to thousands of dollars over traditional car rental companies. He believes that in
        doing so, a larger problem in the world can be solved, connecting the have-nots in this
        world with adequate, reliable means of transportation.
